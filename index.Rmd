## What this application do
  
This application is a **"Time Series Explorer"**, with some pre-programming **Filter** on data.

This **"Time Series Explorer"** correspondants to the frequency of a **Call Center** in parllel to the **Web Site** of a company.

The aim of this application is to see the correlation between the Web and Call, and explore this correlation to optimize the **Call Center** influence.


--- .class #id 

## How get the Data Simulated: 

The Data is simulated with this code:
  
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Simulating Data
df.web <- data.frame(
  time = seq(Sys.time(), len=100, by="1 min")[sample(100, 200,replace = TRUE)],
  type_data = "Web",web = 1,call = 0,
  question = rbinom(200,1,.75),
  answered = rep(NA,200),abandonned = rep(NA,200))
# Head Data
df.web[1:5,]
```


--- .class #id 

## Pre-Programming Filtering:

Pre-programming filters are a kind of filter on data Web or Call, that we can choose via `selectInput` :

### 1. Filter Web:
We have two filters:
* The first one is plot All Data
* The second filter plot the session only with question.

### 2. Filter Call:
We have three filters here:
* The first one is plot All Data of Call Center
* Plot only the frequency of call answered
* Plot only the frequency of call abandonned

--- .class #id 
## Plotting Options:

We used `radioButtonscan` to choose one of the three these plotting modes (default web):
  
* Only Web Data
* Only Call Data
* Both Web and Call Data

We also can modify the step of calculating frequency (default pause = 5 min), here we used `sliderInput`.

## Application Interface 

The principal menu of the application seems very simple, so we can navigate to the `Documenation` rubrique.
